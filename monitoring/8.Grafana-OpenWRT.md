# Grafana OpenWRT 
## 1. How to connect
- `influx -host <ipaddress> -port <port> -database <database_name> -username <table_name> -password <password>`

## 2. CPU
- `SELECT mean("usage_user") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
  + Trả về giá trị `field` trung bình của `usage_user` từ measurement `cpu`
  + tag `cpu`= cpu-total và host bằng tên của server 
  + GROUP BY time: tính giá trị trung bình trong khoảng thời gian 10s
- `SELECT mean("usage_system") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
- `SELECT mean("usage_idle") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
- `SELECT mean("usage_nice") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
- `SELECT mean("usage_irq") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
- `SELECT mean("usage_softirq") FROM "cpu" WHERE ("cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND "host" =~ /^$hostname$/) AND $timeFilter GROUP BY time(10s) fill(null)`
